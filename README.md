## Notes on Development
This python application is designed to scrape information from seperate websites: Nasa Mars News Site, Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, Space Facts,  and USGS astrology. The goal was to provide a website that would contain up-to-date information on, and pictures of Mars using the scraped data. The website is straightforward to use. Simply click the button to scrape current information. Scraped items include: the latest headline title and preview paragraph from Nasa Mars News Site,  the latest featured image from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a facts table from Space Facts, and images of Mars' four hemispheres from USGS astrology. Since this app and website were designed with desktops in mind, The images of Mars' hemispheres have been stacked to take advantage of larger screens and scrolling abilities. Happy Learning!<br><br>

## Files Included
Most of the main files are found in the Missions_to_Mars folder. The folder contains the  app.py file, which is the centerpiece of the project. Running app.py will grant access to the website via developer tools. Other files include: mission_to_mars.ipynb which is used for scraping and analysis, mars_facts.html which is the mars facts table converted from python to html, scrape_mars.py which handles all the data scraping, and a templates folder which contains the index.html for html/bootstrap. The Resources folder in the main repository contains the preview image of the website. <br><br>
